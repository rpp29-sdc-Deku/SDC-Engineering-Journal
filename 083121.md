## Overview
Selected MySQL as the primary DB for Ratings and Reviews. Since Ratings and Reviews is a highly relational feature of this project. Each review has several sub-features that must be associated with each other. The front end of this feature gives the user a great deal of flexibility in choosing how to search, sort, display rating and review data. Using MySQL will allow me to experiment with optimizing those aspects on the back end. Perhaps most importantly, this database must efficiently service many requests from the Related Products feature, all of which are keyed to product ids. Using MySQL will allow me to fine tune relationships between tables and generate new indexes for use cases that are as yet unpredicted/unpredictable.
